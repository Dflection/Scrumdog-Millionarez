First Scrum meeting 
1/16/24
Andrew will be working on student class. has made into a branch//commited 
Chase is doing circuler linked list and que and a tick system that tracks the # of ms students can see sign
Josh P is working on Gui
Josh F is gambling his life away (actual flat tire)
Dylan is taking notes and working on gui with josh P

  Brainstorming 
  file is going run simulation
  summary of students who saw slides
  average number of students slides
  list of students depending on days (2 day student sees %, 3 day %) 
  speed bump interest would it change the visability of signs because of slower speed

  Make a que system for each day / store the signs in object 
  if student sees sign add to list / if student see sign again don't add
  gui system will have user input 
  entry for # of students
  entry for # of signs
  entry for time of sign display
  entry for speed of car
  entry for standard deviation of speed of car
  entry for standard deviation of sign speed
  //entry for how long student see the sign
  display how many signs each student saw
  display average number of signs seen thruout the week
  display avg number of signs 1 day/2 day student saw up to 5

  Created Flowchart.
  Established who's working on what.
  Andrew: made foundation of student class and its child-classes, helped with gameplan.
  Josh P: made shell of Gui-- right now it doesn't lead anywhere, just has entry tables that do nothing yetm, helped with gameplan, created flowchart.
  Dylan: helped everyone figure out what they are going to do, took notes, helped create gameplan/ shell for gui.
  Josh F: "Allegedly" Got a Flat Tire, when called gave some thoughts.
  Chase: Started review past code to make his circular list, create gameplan, helped with brain storming.

What we want to accomplish by next Tuesday 1/21/2025
  Dylan: Plans to make outline of sign module (template for it), count how many signs columbia has in rotation right now.
  Josh P: Make complete shell of the Gui, give it an image, give good appearance, check in on others.

  Andrew (Actual Flat Tire)

WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH FOR 1/23/2025

  Mess around with merges and better understand github.

WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED TODAY 1/23/2025

  Josh P’s inputs for his gui will be [# of Students] [speed] [# of signs] [time signs are displayed]
  Andrew will convert speed to amount of time student sees the sign because Chase has his stuff setup for second.
  Andrew will create a function to essentially create varying instances of the student class based off Josh P’s GUI inputs to send to Chase.
  Chase’s code will generate the simulation and data for how many seconds the student saw each sign.
  Chase will then make that data into dictionary items for each student and send them to Josh F.
  Josh F. will store that data in the ScrumDatabase and then send back the data with transcribed/filtered data for the base results.
  We discussed perhaps adding a button that pulls up the database so that the user can view it if they choose to. 
  Dylan will be in charge of main branch/file. 

WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH BY 1/28/2025
  
  meet online 1/25 @ 8 to work on legit merges and working test branch so Dylan can connect the files by class Tues.
